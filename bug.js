This bug occurs when using the Expo DocumentPicker API on Android.  The issue is that the selected file's URI is not consistently returned in the expected format. Sometimes the URI is a content URI (e.g., `content://...`) and other times it's a file URI (e.g., `file:///storage/...`). This inconsistency makes handling the selected files difficult, as different URIs require different methods for accessing file contents.  Additionally, when using a file URI, permissions issues are often encountered because the app doesn't have direct access to files outside its own private storage.
